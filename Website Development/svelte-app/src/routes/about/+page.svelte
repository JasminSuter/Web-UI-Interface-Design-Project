<h1>About us  </h1>

<p>We are a website dedicated to the artist. Our vision is to streamline the interactions and communication between patron and artist.
 To create an environment in which the artist can create a sustainable living and showcase their work.  </p>

<p>Often the artist is an afterthought as algorithm is first. It is important for us to not fall into that trap. 
Our algorithm is to benefit the artist. To prioritize our artists' futures and businesses.  </p>

<p>Join us on an artist first approach. </p>

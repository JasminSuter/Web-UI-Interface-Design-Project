The title of our website is ART/SRJ. ART/SRJ is a website used to get commission from artists. Our intention is to make a website that values the artist first, so the focus is to drive work and promote artists. The names ART/SRJ comes from the combination of our different initials. 

The reason we chose this as a website is that a lot of art-based websites are used and promoted more as social media. Although social media elements are important is then can cause an over saturation of users only there for that aspect so the commissions can get lost. This website is to focus on original work. We felt threw was a gap in the marke2t for an art/ commission focused website.

Key Features 

For the website itself we have a few main goals. The main user needs are to have a profile, A discovery page and a commission page. Our goal is to make a page for each of these. To have the main page where there is a gride of visual content that the user can navigate. Along the top of the page to have navigation between the different pages. At the bottom of the footer to have core pages such as FAQ, contact, news etc. The commission page would have a form that the user can fill in to either request or apply for a commission. The users page would have a profile picture and general information about the user. The users upload would also be on their profile page.  

The pages on our website are the homepage, 404, about, blog, FAQ, login, profile, requests, terms and conditions and the requests page. 

The interactive elements include page navigation, The hamburger menu on the smaller screen. The images themselves. The profile page, searching, the logo, and the login page.  

 We used GitHub, Microsoft word, svelte, HTML/CSS, discord and procreate to make the website. These Microsoft words were used to organize information and references. Procreate was used to create the assets for the website, wireframes, and branding choices. Discord was used for communication. 

 

Team reflections 

Rebecca: For the website I worked on the 404 page, the about page and the main page. I also focused on the main styling of the website. They included the main formatting throughout, colour choices and designing the logo. I had a lot of issues learning svelte. I find it intimidating when approaching something new. So, it took me a while to not only understand what I was doing but to also feel comfortable using it. I feel as though we had overestimated our ability to complete what the website needs. The type of website we wanted to make has a lot of interactive elements especially when we get to the forms. I spent a lot of time just trying to sort the basics while learning how to use svelte. What I learned was the use of svelte and how to format pages on a website. It improved my approach to projects such as this. Understanding what is doable at my skill level and what I need to improve upon. I also worked as the main person on the3 readme document. 

 

Sophia (SophiaStanley): For the website I worked on the Request, Log in, and FAQ pages as well as adding the components, some animations like the logo spinning when you hover over it, and responsiveness such as adding a burger menu to the header on smaller screens. For challenges I faced, HTML and CSS have never been my strong suits, so I still found it a bit difficult to have to use them as well as using the new Svelte framework, which I’d never even heard of before, and learning JavaScript as well. The lecture notes and looking up resources like W3 Schools really helped me understand how to use these more effectively. Adding the dynamic log in page turned out to be very difficult as I did not fully understand JavaScript and localStorage. Thankfully, Libor and a resource online were able to help me get it functioning to the level needed for this project. For what I learned, I think I was a little too ambitious in what I wanted to add to the website, like having a properly working login system with backend coding, or adding a fully functional uploading system, which would’ve been very difficult to do with what we’ve learned so far. I’ve learned about the importance of keeping things simple and also asking for help when you need it, as I don’t think I would have been able to fix the log in page without asking for help from others. 

 

Jasmin: I worked on the Profile page, the user terms and the news page, as well as helping with design choices. One of the main challenges was actually understanding svelte overall. At first it was a bit of a struggle to get used to it, but after using it for a while it feels like a very helpful tool. The other big challenge was the profile page as I had to learn how to use the card feature, how to style and animate them and how to fit images into them without messing up the whole layout. I created multiple different cards so they can look differently depending on their function. Initially I wanted the card to expand to the size of the image once hovered over, however this proofed too difficult to implement and I opted for showing the whole image inside the slightly enlarged card instead, but this would be something I’d like to improve if I continued working on the page. Overall, I definitely learned how much time is actually needed to get a website running and how many components are needed to have a well-designed and intuitive website. 

Deployment notes. 

Git pages URL: https://github.com/JasminSuter/Web-UI-Interface-Design-Project.git  

There were a few issues. Most of which were the learning curve of svelte. We all worked on separate aspects of the site so there were very few merger conflicts. 

 

Website reflection 

What went well in this project was the design and concept. We had a very clear vision and understanding of what we wanted to do. The colours and concept did not change much throughout the process. The basics of the website also went well, for example the static pages. 

What can be improved would be better communication throughout the project. We also should have set out with more realistic goals as the website design had a lot more interactions compared to the website as of current. 

For future development there would need to be a focus on the images. How to upload them. To create an algorithm for the main page. To get them to display on people's profiles.
